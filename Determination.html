                    not just how to help people follow a treatment plan, or to take meds, but to understand the
                    importance of relationships in healing, and being healed.</p>

                <p class="image-text2"> I have joined multiple research groups and gained a variety of skills from my
                    experiene. From how to give injections, to analyzing data. Most recently I have been participating
                    in a machine learning project which has pushed me to my limits, and taught me how to be engaged in
                    pro-active learning of topics that were beyond my reach.</p>

                <p class="image-text3"> I've shadowed a few doctors, as well as taken a course named Surgical Decision by
                    Dr. Brian Gill. He discoursed on his experience from both medical student to Lead Trauma Surgeon and
                    the choices and situations that were involved along the course of his experienec. It was eye
                    opening, but exciting. As it was confirmed in my heart that this was the directoin I was suppose to
                    go.</p>
